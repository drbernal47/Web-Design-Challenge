    <h1>Summary: Latitude vs. X</h1>
    <p>
        The purpose of this group project was to analyze data from the World Happiness Report and compare it to data
        about internet usage in various countries around the world. Our group first cleaned the data from multiple csv files,
        then pulled all the data together in a single dataframe.
    </p>

    <p>
        Analyzing our data, we found multiple positive and significant correlations between various subscores of the World Happiness 
        Score each country received and the percentage of citizens with internet access. While we were not able to determine causality, 
        we did find several correlations that were thought-provoking and would make for interesting projects in the future.
