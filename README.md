# Web-Design-Challenge
This challenge is part of a homework assignment showcasing knowledge of html and css.

The data and analysis from this website comes from the group project I worked on earlier in this course, which can be found at: https://github.com/drbernal47/project-1-group-7. The contributors of this project were: Daniel Bernal, Mason Totall, Rebecca Tricker, and Steve Gaetz.

The project sought to answer the question: does the internet make us happy? The data used was from various' countries and included internet usage (percentage of population) in 2019 compared to the World Happiness Report findings from 2019.

The landing page (https://drbernal47.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/dataset.html) gives you a brief description of the project, has a responsive navbar and contents, and includes a sidebar that allows you to preview the four data visualizations found in the project.

Clicking on any of the data visualizations brings you to a deeper analysis of that data (each on a separate page). Each page is responsive and also has the same navbar and sidebar with previews.

A "Comparison" page is also included that shows the preview images larger (and still allows you to go to those specific pages when you click on them).

Finally, the data we used is available in a table. This table was generated using the Pandas "to_html" function from the original data-frame.
